## bubbleSort
### Best Case
#### The best case is when the array is already sorted because it does not need to preform any swaps.

### Worst Case
#### The worst case is when the array is completely descending because it needs to preform (n-pass) swaps each pass.


## selectionSort
#### There is no best or worst case because it always swaps one value per pass regardless if it is ordered. When it is ascending, each pass will have a value swapping with itself, which takes just as much memory as swapping two values.

# insertionSort
### Best Case
#### The best case is when the array is already sorted because it does not need to preform any swaps.

### Worst Case
#### The worst case is when the array is completely descending because it needs to preform (n-pass) swaps each pass.
